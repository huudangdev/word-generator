### Microsoft Word is a very popular word processor. It is a popular format for making and exchanging documents. Therefore, a feature of a lot of apps is to create Word documents from other kinds of documents. Creating Word documents is easy in Node.js apps with third party libraries. We can make an app from it easily ourselves.

## Back End

Then in the backend folder run npx express-generator to create the Express app. Then run npm i to install the packages Next we install our own packages. We need Babel for run the app with the latest version of JavaScript, CORS for cross domain requests with front end, HTML-DOCX-JS for converting HTML strings to Word documents, Multer for file upload, Sequelize for ORM, and SQLite3 for our database.
